# Wastewater surveillance

Molecular monitoring of wastewater to help Public Health understand the presence of disease in a community and inform intervention strategies\
+ regardless of clinical testing strategies, access to testing, and the sample size of symptomatic individuals who have taken tests ![](img/WSI.png)

# Current state

-   methods (and labs) remain disparate
-   QAQC measures (?) ![](img/interlab_method_tbl.png)

# Surveillance proficiency

*Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?*

### Interlab Reports

### under the hood: our core code base

![](img/code_structure_existing.png)

*so with the interlabs the past four years, we're at the stage where none of the methods are wild anymore (though sitll good to keep an eye on mutation effects) - so we can evolve to a high level task (which is our mandate for PHAC)*

### under the hood: transforming raw input

*R \<- anywhere from 10-20 labs. each with their own established spreadsheets filling the unified interlab submittal. granularly for statistical tests - three replicates of three replicates of however many targets (we provide for 4 different SARS genes, flu A, flu B, the 3 RSVs) which are different for each lab*

# Future

-   develop the visibility for quality control
-   client/lab-side quality check for PT (web dev....)
-   code refactoring & continue documentation
