# Wastewater surveillance

Molecular monitoring of wastewater to help Public Health understand the presence of disease in a community and inform intervention strategies  
+ regardless of clinical testing strategies, access to testing, and the sample size of symptomatic individuals who have taken tests

# Current state
- methods (and labs) remain disparate 
- QAQC measures (?)

### under the hood: our core code base

*so with the interlabs the past four years, we're at the stage where none of the methods are wild anymore (though sitll good to keep an eye on mutation effects) - so we can evolve to a high level task (which is our mandate for PHAC)*

### under the hood: transforming raw input
![](img/rawInput.png)
  
*R <- anywhere from 10-20 labs.  each with their own established spreadsheets filling the unified interlab submittal.  granularly for statistical tests - three replicates of three replicates of however many targets (we provide for 4 different SARS genes, flu A, flu B, the 3 RSVs) which are different for each lab*


# Future
- develop the visibility for quality control
- client/lab-side quality check for PT
- code refactoring & documentation
